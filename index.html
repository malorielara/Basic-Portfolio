            My name is Malorie Alyssa Lara.  I am 22 years old and enjoy many things, but 
            particularly, spending time at home or with friends.  I am a home-body person 
            but when I'm out with friends, I like to be active and social.  My family consists 
            of my mom, Rebecca, dad, Jose, sister, Hailea, and two little dogs, Eloise and Hazel.
        <br>

            Throughout my life I have played many sports, but since I was 9, I have loved 
            soccer the most.  When I was 10, I had a spiral fracture that you would think 
            would have kept me from playing, but it didn't.  It actually made me that much 
            more excited and tough for the upcoming seasons.  
        <br>
        <br>
            When it came to college, I wanted to be close enough to home but also far enough 
            to where I was able to become my own person and do my own things.  I chose a school 
            that was about an hour away.  That school was Southwestern University.  I was able 
            to fulfill my dreams and play soccer for the university at the collegiate level.  
            I was also able to check off a goal when I scored my first collegiate hat-trick my 
            sophomore year.  
        <br>
        <br>
                Some hobbies I enjoy are: Soccer/Sports, Kayaking, Paddleboarding, Swimming, 
            Relaxing and sipping on Margs or a beer with my friends.
